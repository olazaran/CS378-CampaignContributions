The Campaign Contribution Tableau project was worked on when

Oracle server was unstable, therefore I worked on Tableau by having

a local Dataset.

I wanted to upload .twbx so that those dataset could also be uploaded,

but github's file size limit was 100MB and .twbx was 196MB

the Dataset you will have to link/download are:

the Whole set of Campaign Contribution of 2012,

SQL filtered set where all Contributor_Occupation that contained "student" string

and 

SQL filtered set where all Contributor_Occupation that contained "retired" string
